# Learning Optimal Individualized Treatment Rules (ITRs) for Latent Outcomes

For many mental disorders, latent mental status inferred from multiple-domain psychological or clinical symptoms may perform as a better characterization of the underlying disorder status than a simple summary score of the symptoms, and they may also serve as more reliable and representative features to differentiate treatment responses.

We provide a new paradigm for learning optimal individualized treatment rules (ITRs) by modeling patients' latent mental status.  We first learn the multi-domain latent states at baseline from the observed symptoms under a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) model. We then optimize a value function defined by the latent states after treatment by exploiting a transformation of the observed symptoms based on the RBM without modeling the relationship between the latent mental states before and after treatment.
